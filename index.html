        <h1> Welcome to my quiz!</h1>
        <p>This is a test playground for me to learn while taking classes on web development.</p>
        <p>This is a quiz I've designed to test knowledge of Pokemon type matchups.</p>
        <p>You have 4 options of effectiveness: 
            <ul> 
                <li>No effect (0.0)</li> 
                <li>Not very effective (0.5)</li>
                <li>Neutrally effective (1.0)</li>
                <li>Super effective (2.0)</li>  
            </ul>
        </p>
    <p>Each question will present the attacking type, and defending type.<br>Your job is to determine how effective the attacking type is against the defending type.</p>
<p>There are 8 total questions. Have fun! </p>
