      <h1>Welcome to my quiz!</h1>
      <p>
        This is a test playground for me to learn while taking classes on web
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a quiz I've designed to test knowledge of Pokemon type matchups.
      </p>
      <p>You have 4 options of effectiveness:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No effect (0.0)</li>
        <li>Not very effective (0.5)</li>
        <li>Neutrally effective (1.0)</li>
        <li>Super effective (2.0)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each question will present the attacking type, and defending type.
        <br />Your job is to determine how effective the attacking type is
        against the defending type.
      </p>
      <p>There are 8 total questions. Have fun!</p>
