Hello! This is part of an assignment for my classes I'm taking through Code:You. I wanted to test my skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Mainly JavaScript because I have had some issues understanding it. That's why I decided to work on a 'quiz' so I could incorporate quite a few elements of JS in my file, such as pulling up questions, and keeping a score and even linking to a new page for the results! It was fun but also very difficult. I'm sure there's some things I could have done better, but I did my best on this! Thanks for checking it out! :D
